# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To do this, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website is utilized to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days where the data is then added to a map.
